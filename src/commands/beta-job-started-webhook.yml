  Send a webhook that a job has started. This is currently in beta and uses
  the swissknife backend. To use this you need to have a swissknife API available
  from beta.swissknife.dev. Set your Swissknife api key in the SWISSKNIFE_API_KEY env
  variable.

  This command sends a webhook on job start.

  In order to have this webhook sent as early as possible, make this step as early as possible
  on the job, preferably event before the checkout step.

  All webhooks are signed with the Signing key set in Swissknife.

parameters:
  destination:
    description: The URL where the webhook should be posted to.
    type: string
  fail-on-error:
    description: Fails this step on error otherwise, this is best effort
    type: boolean
    default: true
  vcs-type:
    description: The type of VCS backing this repo. Defaults to gh for github
    type: string
    default: gh
